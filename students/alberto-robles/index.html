          <h3>Where Am I From? You Wonder!</h3>
          <p>I'm from Mexico City, but I lived the last 3 years in Cancun
             (I want to think you know this city).

          <h3>My Life Before Going RED</h3>
          <p>Before enrolling at RED Academy, I studied Audio Engineering and Music Production
            at <em>Academia de MÃºsica Fermatta</em> in Mexico City. After that, I moved in with my
            father in Cancun, where I was helping him with his car rental company. I was the manager.
            <br />In October 2017, I travelled to Mexico City from Cancun to visit my mother and friends.
            In this trip, my best friend Javier (who is enrolled at RED Academy too) convinced me to enroll
            at RED and take this adventure with him. I didn't think it twice. So, I'm here!

          <h3>Goals After Red</h3>
          <p>I want to continue learning more about programming. I want to keep developing webpages, apps, videogames... perhaps.
             While developing myself.
