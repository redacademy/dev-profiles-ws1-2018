    <h4>Life before RED</h4>
    <div style="text-align:left">
    <p>
        Hola! My name is Tony, and I enjoy eating insects, cliff jumping into lakes, and tap dancing Just joking! I hate all
        of those thing. on a serious note, before I enrolled at RED academy I was working full time at a nursing home. I've been working in the health care industry for 5 years now, and I believe It's time for a change.

        I gotta say, my best travel experience would be hands down EDC (electric daisy carnival) It's a musical
        festival that occurs throughout the year at many different locations, having Vegas as the best spot for this surreal
        once in a life time changing experience. Words can't describe the amount of fun I had while partying with new friends
        from all around the world from all walks of life. Everyone second was a blast, and it was positive and goodvibes
        all around, everyone there was extremly friendly and welcoming.
