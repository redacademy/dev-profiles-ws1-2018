            <h2>Hometown</h2>
            <p class="p-center">Ostrava, Czech Republic</p>
            <p class="p-center"><a href="https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Ostrava,+Česko/@50.2749744,17.1774432,6.1z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x4711586a3124e79d:0x891973fb9f9e9144!8m2!3d49.8211511!4d18.2620239">see a map</a></p>

            <h2>Before RED</h2>
            <p>I studied Biomedical Engineering. I spent 3 summers at a camp in the US (working as an office assistant, camp counselor and ropes course supervisor). I got Working Holiday visa in Canada and decided to come to Vancouver. So here I am.</p>

            <h2>Fun fact</h2>
            <p>No one actually calls me Katerina. We consider it too official in Czech. There are around 35 nicknames you can make by changing my name a little bit (I can show you the list). But most people call me Kach.</p>
            <p>Also my name in Czech is written as Kateřina. It contains a letter 'ř' which doesn't exist in any other language in the world and it's really hard to pronounce.</p>

            <h2>Best travel experience</h2>
            <p>I have a lot of great memories while traveling. The best ones usually involve having a great time with my family/friends as well as some crazy stories. My favorite are these:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Family vacation in Thailand</li>
                <li>Westcoast roadtrip in the US</li>
                <li>New Year's trip to Rome</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Countries I would love to visit</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Peru</li>
                <li>Australia &amp; New Zeland</li>
                <li>Iceland</li>
                <li>Cambodia</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Secret talent</h2>
            <p>I have a secret talent of burning my hair when I make a fire. It happened to me three times during the summer when I was teaching outdoor cooking classes.</p>
            
            <h2>Goals after RED</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Becoming a front-end developer</li>
                <li>Trying to work as a freelancer</li>
                <li>Travel around the world - my next destination would be South America or Australia</li>
                <li>Write a book</li>
            </ul>
