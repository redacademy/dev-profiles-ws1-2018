     <h2> LIFE BEFORE RED ACADEMY </h2>
     <p class="paragraph">
     
     Prior to joining RED Academy as a web development student, I was a  student at The University of British columbia, studying Statistics but decided to take off from school to pursue web development career at a tech school that would equip me with  a real world experience in the tech industry. And I ended up at RED Academy for the said purpose.

     <h2>Secret Talent</h2>
     <p class="paragraph"> 
         One bite at a time finishes an elephant. I enjoy doing a big project by breaking it down into small manageable pieces and single handle each piece until the whole task is complete.

     <h2> Goals After Completeing the Web Developer program at RED </h2>
     
     <p class="paragraph">  After completing  web developer program at RED, I would like to pass the web developer knowledge onto the other persons who are passionate about building Websites from scratch. Also, I would like to own and maintain my own website for personal projects.
